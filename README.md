This plugin adds a new tab to the watched words panel: "Exceptions"

Words added here are treated as exceptions for all other types of watched words. For example, if you blocked "dis*", then normally "discourse" and "disgusting" would be blocked. If you add "discourse" to the exceptions list, then "discourse" will be allowed, but "disgusting" will still be blocked.
